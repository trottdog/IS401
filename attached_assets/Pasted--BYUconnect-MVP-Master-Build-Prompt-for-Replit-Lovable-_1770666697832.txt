# BYUconnect MVP – Master Build Prompt (for Replit / Lovable)

## ROLE

You are a senior mobile engineer + senior product designer. Your job is to build a **production-quality MVP** for **BYUconnect**, a BYU-only campus events & clubs mobile application. The app must faithfully implement the attached **high-fidelity wireframes**, **Product Spec**, and **ERD**, and follow modern mobile UX/UI best practices.

The UI should feel **Instagram-minimal**, clean, slate-based, and uncluttered, with subtle BYU color accents. Where multiple tabs exist, they must be **equal width and span the full screen**. The app should feel fast, calm, and purposeful.

---

## PRODUCT VISION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Time-first discovery**

   * Default sorting prioritizes events happening **now**, then **soonest upcoming**.
   * Distance is a secondary tie-breaker only when time is equal.

2. **Clubs are the supply side**

   * Events are always created and owned by **clubs**, never individuals.
   * Event cards and detail pages must display the **club name**, not a user.

3. **Low-friction, non-social**

   * NO comments, likes, DMs, follower counts, or social feeds.
   * This is not a social network. It is a campus utility.

4. **BYU-only context**

   * Only BYU campus buildings, BYU clubs, and BYU events.
   * No off-campus aggregation or external organizations.

5. **Limited capacity events**

   * Some events optionally require reservations.
   * If enabled, users must reserve to attend.
   * Show remaining spots, but never show attendee lists or check-ins.

---

## RECOMMENDED MVP TECH STACK

* **Mobile:** Expo (React Native) + TypeScript
* **Navigation:** React Navigation or Expo Router
* **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, RLS)
* **Maps:** react-native-maps
* **Payments:** Mock provider (Stripe-like flow, no real charging required)
* **Analytics:** Database-level event interaction logging

---

## REQUIRED SCREENS & FLOWS

### Authentication

* Email/password login (placeholder for future BYU SSO)
* Create User record on first login

### Core Navigation (Bottom Tabs)

1. **Map** (primary discovery)
2. **MyClubs**
3. **Profile**

Bottom navigation must always be visible and minimal.

---

### Map / List Discovery

* Default view: **Map with building pins**
* Each pin represents a BYU building and shows event count
* Tapping a pin opens a **bottom sheet** with events in that building
* Toggle between **Map** and **List** using equal-width segmented tabs

**List View Requirements**

* Event cards styled like minimal Instagram posts
* Clear start time and “Now / Soon / Today” labels
* Club name visible, no poster avatar

---

### Search

* Persistent search entry point
* Search across:

  * Events
  * Clubs
  * Buildings
  * Categories / tags
* Results organized into equal-width segmented tabs (Top / Events / Clubs / Buildings)

---

### Filters (Bottom Sheet)

Priority order:

1. Time window
2. Category
3. Club
4. Location (building)
5. Food provided

Filters must be fast, state-preserving, and dismissible.

---

### Event Detail Screen

Must include:

* Event title
* Club name
* Time & date
* Building + map link
* Description
* Category tags

Primary actions:

* **Reserve Spot** (if limited capacity)
* **Save Event** (bookmark)

Secondary actions:

* Share link
* Add to calendar (ICS export)
* Open directions

---

### MyClubs

* List of clubs the user belongs to
* Entry point for club discovery
* Clear indication of admin roles

---

### Club Profile

Tabs (equal width):

* About
* Activity (events + announcements)
* Contact

Must support:

* Public view for non-members
* Admin controls for authorized users

---

### Club Admin Mode

Users with admin/president roles can:

* Switch into club context
* Create, edit, cancel events
* Post announcements
* Approve or deny join requests
* View basic analytics

Admin permissions must be enforced via backend rules.

---

### Notifications

* In-app notification center
* Notification preference toggles

Trigger notifications for:

* Event time/location changes (saved events)
* Reservation confirmations or cancellations
* Club announcements
* Membership approvals or denials

---

## DATA MODEL (MUST MATCH ERD)

Implement the following tables:

* User
* Club
* ClubMembership
* MembershipRequest
* Building
* Category
* Event
* EventSave
* Reservation
* Announcement
* Notification
* NotificationPreference
* Payment
* EventInteraction
* EventChangeLog
* Report

### Critical Rules

* Unique (user_id, club_id) memberships
* Unique (user_id, event_id) saves
* Reservation required when limited capacity is enabled
* Event updates create change logs and notifications

---

## PERMISSIONS & SECURITY

* Supabase Auth + Row Level Security
* Students can read published events
* Only club admins can create or modify their club’s events
* No user-authored public content

---

## SORTING & RANKING LOGIC

Default ordering:

1. Events happening now
2. Soonest upcoming events
3. Distance (tie-breaker only)

No algorithmic “For You” feed in MVP.

---

## SEED DATA REQUIREMENTS

Seed the database with:

* 10 BYU buildings (lat/long)
* 10 categories
* 12 clubs
* 40 events across the next 7 days
* Mixed capacity events
* Example student user
* Example club admin user

---

## ANALYTICS

Log EventInteraction records for:

* Impression
* View
* Save
* Map click
* Calendar export
* Reservation

Provide a simple admin analytics view summarizing these counts.

---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Fully running Expo app
2. Supabase SQL schema + RLS policies
3. Seed scripts
4. README explaining setup and testing

---

## UX / UI QUALITY BAR

* Slate-based color palette with subtle BYU accents
* Equal-width tabs everywhere tabs exist
* No clutter, no social mechanics
* Minimum 44px touch targets
* Accessible contrast and typography

Build this MVP as if it will be demoed to BYU stakeholders and engineering leadership.
